# CPP_Codes
These are C++ codes I have done for some classes where C++ was the programming language. Some were old projects or old exams. Some of the codes, such as the data structures, were done as a refresher to my data structures and algorithm classes. Note that these files were written on Microsoft Visual Studio and on Windows 7. Also some files may have lines using windows specific commands. Some project codes may require an old setup of MS Visual Studio solutions that has Borland Graphics Interface (BGI) integrated.
