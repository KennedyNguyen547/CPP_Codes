These files implement a basic binary tree with no access to the parent.
I simply used recursion and post order traversal for the destructor.
For the deletion method, I used an iterative approach to locate the nodes and used the successor node approach.
For the insertion method, I used an iterative approach as well to locate the position of the node to insert.
Also the way the insertion and deletion are implemented, nodes with duplicate values are allowed.
I implemented a recursive in order traversal to test the implementation.
Note that I cannot guarantee that everything will work. These were written and tested on Microsoft Visual Studio and on Windows 7.
